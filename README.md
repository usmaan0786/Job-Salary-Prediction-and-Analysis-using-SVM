# Job-Salary-Prediction-and-Analysis-using-SVM
Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. While SVMs are commonly used for classification, they can also be used for regression to predict numerical values, such as job salaries. In the case of job salary prediction, SVM regression can be used to create a model that takes various features of a job (e.g., years of experience, education level, location, etc.) as input and predicts the corresponding salary as output.
